## Create Magazine 📖

### Overview & Structure

Articles should be text files, with optional images.  
It is recommended to put a blank newline between each paragraph.  
Articles will be processed in alphabetical order.  
A suggested file name format is `article_XX.txt` e.g. `article_01.txt`, `article_02.txt` etc.  
Articles and images need to go in a folder named `to_process`.

Article images have `ink_saver.png` applied to remove part of it. This is just to save some ink.

Each page will first be a `png` file in the directory `pages`.  
The magazine will finally be assembled into a `pdf` file for printing. e.g. `magazine_2024_02_27_20_09_39.pdf`

### Sample Directory

```
my_magazine/
    MAGENV/
    AutoMagor/
        __main__.py
        README.md
        ...
    to_process/
        article_01.txt
        article_01.png
        article_02.txt
        article_02.jpg
        ...
```

### article.txt Format

e.g. `to_process\article_01.txt`
```txt
title:The Title of This Article
subtitle:A subtitle for this Article
author:Foo Bar
date:January 1, 2024
image:article_01.png
source: Text that will appear after the date
body:
The first sentence of the first paragrph. The second sentence of the first paragraph.

The second paragraph is here. Another sentence in the second paragraph.
```
